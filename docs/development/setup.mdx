This document aims to guide you through the process of setting up a local installation of AgentGPT. It's important to note that we recommend using Docker for this installation. Docker simplifies the process and ensures that all dependencies are correctly handled, making the installation process more straightforward and less error-prone.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, please make sure you have the following installed:

1. [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
2. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
3. An [OpenAI API key](https://beta.openai.com/signup/)
4. A code editor of your choice, such as [Visual Studio Code (VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

### Docker Installation (Recommended)

In addition to the prerequisites listed above, Docker is also necessary for this setup. Follow the steps below for Docker installation:

1. Download and install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
2. After installation, create a Docker account if you don't have one
3. Open the Docker Desktop application and sign in

## Installation with Docker

1. **Open your editor**

2. **Open the Terminal** - Typically, you can do this from a 'Terminal' tab or by using a shortcut
   (e.g., `Ctrl + ~` for Windows or `Control + ~` for Mac in VS Code).

3. **Clone the Repository and Navigate into the Directory** - Once your terminal is open, you can clone the repository and move into the directory by running the commands below.

   **For Mac/Linux users**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/reworkd/AgentGPT.git
   cd AgentGPT
   ./setup.sh
   ```

   **For Windows users**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/reworkd/AgentGPT.git
   cd AgentGPT
   ./setup.bat
   ```

4. **Follow the setup instructions from the script** - add the appropriate API keys, and once all of the services are running, travel to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) on your web-browser.

## Installation without Docker

Outside of docker, you'll need to just configure your ENV. Additionally, you can use `setup.sh` to walkthrough ENV
configuration and also update your Prisma configuration to point to a local SQLite
instance.

After this, you can run the following to set up your Next.js project.

```bash
// Frontend
cd ./next
npm install
npm run dev
```

In a different window, you can run the following to start the backend:

```bash
// Backend. Make sure you are at the root of the project
cd ./platform
poetry install
poetry run python -m reworkd_platform
```

## Running the site

Congratulations on successfully setting up AgentGPT on your local machine! To see the fruit of your work, open your preferred web browser and visit [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/). There, you'll find the AgentGPT user interface ready for you to explore and interact with.
